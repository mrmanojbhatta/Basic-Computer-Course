<h1>A Basic Computer Course</h1>
 <p>The word "computer" originated from the Latin word "compute." "Compute" means to calculate or count. An electronic machine that can store data and find information, do calculations, and control other machines is called a computer. It works only when we give some input; otherwise, it is like a dead body. It is a machine that can solve a number of problems. Computers are used in various fields such as schools, education, business, homes, industries, and communication, etc.</p>
    
<h2>We can define a Computer as:</h2>
 <p class="definition">“A computer is an electronic device which accepts data from the user, processes it inside the C.P.U, and gives meaningful results as output.”</p>
    
<h2>What is the full form of COMPUTER?</h2>

  <li>C = Common</li>
   <li>O = Operating</li>
   <li>M = Machine</li>
   <li>P = Purpose</li>
   <li>U = Useful</li>
   <li>T = Technology</li>
   <li>E = Education</li>

  </ul>
    
  <h2>Main Three Parts of a Computer</h2>
   <h3>1. Input Device</h3>
   <p>Input devices are hardware components used to provide data and control signals to a computer. Common examples include the keyboard, mouse, microphone, and scanner. These devices allow users to interact with the computer, entering information and commands that the computer processes.</p>
    </div>
    
  
  <h3>2. CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h3>
   <p>The CPU is the brain of the computer, responsible for executing instructions from software by performing arithmetic, logic, control, and input/output (I/O) operations. It processes data from input devices and sends the processed data to output devices. The CPU’s performance determines how fast and efficiently a computer can run programs.</p>

   <h3>3. Output Device</h3>
   <p>Output devices are hardware components that convey information from the computer to the user. Examples include monitors, printers, and speakers. These devices display or produce the results of the computer’s processes, such as text, images, or sounds.</p>
    
 <h2>Key Components of a Computer</h2>
   <h3>RAM (Random Access Memory)</h3>
   <p>RAM is a type of volatile memory that temporarily stores data and programs currently in use by the CPU. It allows for quick access and manipulation of data, making it essential for smooth multitasking and overall system performance. When the computer is turned off, the data in RAM is lost.</p>
   <h3>ROM (Read-Only Memory)</h3>
   <p>ROM is non-volatile memory that permanently stores essential instructions needed for the computer to boot up, such as the BIOS. Unlike RAM, the data in ROM is not lost when the computer is turned off, and it cannot be easily modified by the user.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)</h3>
   <p>The ALU is a critical component of the CPU that performs arithmetic (addition, subtraction) and logic (comparison, bitwise operations) operations. It is responsible for executing mathematical calculations and making decisions based on logical conditions.</p>
   <h3>CU (Control Unit)</h3>
   <p>The Control Unit manages the operations of the CPU by directing the flow of data between the CPU, memory, and input/output devices. It interprets instructions from programs and coordinates the activities of all computer components, ensuring that tasks are executed in the correct sequence.</p>
  <h2>How Does a Computer Work?</h2>
   <h3>Input</h3>
   <p>Input refers to the data or commands that are entered into a computer system using input devices such as a keyboard, mouse, or microphone. These inputs are essential for the computer to perform tasks and process information.</p>
   <h3>Process</h3>
   <p>Processing is the action performed by the computer’s CPU to manipulate, calculate, or organize the input data according to a set of instructions (programs). During processing, the CPU executes operations that transform the raw input into meaningful information.</p>
 <h3>Output</h3>
   <p>Output is the result of the computer’s processing, delivered to the user through output devices like monitors, printers, or speakers. The output can be in various forms, such as text, images, sounds, or printed documents.</p>
